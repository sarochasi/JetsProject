# JetsProject

## Overview

The Jets Application is a simulation program that manages a fleet of jets with different capabilities. Users can view the fleet, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load cargo jets, initiate a dogfight, and add or remove jets from the fleet. Each jet has a model, speed (in MPH), range, and price. The program is designed to be extendable with different types of jets and special behaviors through interfaces.
